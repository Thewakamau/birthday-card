				Another year around the sun is always something to celebrate! Sending
				birthday greetings is a wonderful way to honor the birthday of a
				partner, family member, friend, colleague, or any other loved one. When
				you’re deciding which birthday wishes to include within your celebratory
				birthday card gift, consider who you’re writing to. If you’re sending a
				sweet birthday message to a friend, you may want to go with something
				funny that reflects your goofy relationship. Maybe you’re sending a
				birthday card to your grandmother; a sweet birthday quote might be
				better suited. From the flowery and inspirational to the short and
				sweet, we’ve compiled an exhaustive list of lovely birthday messages for
				everyone on your list.
